    "# Introduction\n",
    "In this project, we will analyze data collected by a research group at UBC about how people play video games. Specifically, the research group has set up a Minecraft server to record players' actions and analyze how they navigate the world. However, to ensure they have enough resources to handle the number of players on their server. Our goal is to help with their recruitment efforts, we will be trying to answer which \"kinds\" of players are most likely to contribute a large amount of data to target those players in our recruiting efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset that we will be using to answer our question is the players.csv dataset which consists of a total of 196 observations and 9 different variables: \n",
    "1. **experience (chr):** Player's experience level \n",
    "2. **subscribe (lgl):** Indicates if a player is subscribed to PlaiCraft's email updates\n",
    "3. **hashedEmail (chr):** Scrambled email of a player, which can be unscrambled with a key\n",
    "4. **played_hours (dbl):** Total number of hours the player has played\n",
    "5. **name (chr):** Player's name\n",
    "6. **gender (chr):** Player's Gender\n",
    "7. **age (dbl):** Player's Age\n",
    "8. **individualID (lgl):** Individual ID of player\n",

This is appropriate because we are predicting a categorical variable (experience) using two numerical variables (age, played_hours). First, we wrangle and clean our data to prepare it for analysis:"
